•**COMPUTATION PROCESSORS** :: It is the core hardware components in a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculation.  
•**AMD , intel, ARM** these two are closed surface whereas **RISC-V** is an open source 

•**NETWORKS** :: A network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate and share data with each other . 
TYPES OF NETWORKS 

•**LAN** ( Local Area Network) = it covers small area such as home or office 


~**WAN** (Wide Area Network) = large geographic area ,includes internet 


~**MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) = covers a city or a campus 

•**IP** ( INTERNET PROTOCOL) 
it is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network . It allows device to communicate with each other

~**Private ip**
used within local networks like home 
Assigned by router to devices like phone , laptops and printer 
**Example** 
192.168.x.x

~**Public ip**
Assigned by your **ISP** ( INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER). It is used to identify your network on the internet 
**Example**
103.21.244.0

~**Local Host** it is fixed and it is a special hostname that points to loopback address usually 127.x.y.z

We all are connected to a common ISP(INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER ) 

We have two type of language **Programming languauge**  **Scripting Language** 

~Programming Language is in **Compiler**

~Scripting language is seen in **Interpreter**


•LAN comes under intranet which is private ip whereas WAN comes under internet which is public ip
**O.S**
Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides services for computer programs. It's the layer between the hardware and the user or applications.

**[ User Interface (GUI/CLI) ]**

**[ System Libraries ]**

**[ System Call Interface ]**

**[ Kernel (Core OS functions) ]**

**[ Hardware Abstraction Layer ]**

**[ Hardware ]**
 These are the different layers of Operating System 
 

 **"Bare metal" refers to hardware without any operating system or software layer installed. It’s the "raw" computer—just the physical machine—ready for direct programming or OS installation.**

**Virtual box ::**
VirtualBox is a free and open-source hypervisor developed by Oracle. It allows you to run a full operating system, known as a guest OS, inside your current operating system, or host OS. This creates a virtual environment, a virtual machine (VM), that behaves like a separate computer.


**How It Works**
VirtualBox uses a type of virtualization called hosted virtualization. This means it runs on top of an existing host operating system. The hypervisor intercepts the instructions from the guest OS and translates them into instructions the host's hardware can understand. This process creates a secure, isolated environment for the guest operating system. It's like having a computer within a computer.

**Latency**-Latency is the time delay between the cause and effect of a system change. In simpler terms, it's the time it takes for a single piece of data or a single request to travel from its origin to its destination. . Low latency is crucial for applications that require real-time interaction

**Throughput** -Throughput is the rate at which a system can process or transmit data. It's a measure of volume and is often expressed in terms of bits per second (bps), requests per second, or transactions per second. High throughput is critical for systems that handle large volumes of data or many concurrent users.

A **private cloud** is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. Unlike public clouds (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) that serve multiple clients on shared infrastructure, private clouds provide isolated infrastructure, offering more control, security, and customization.

**Hypervisor**
A hypervisor (also called a virtual machine monitor, or VMM) is software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting the hardware resources of a physical host system.


**What Hypervisors Are Used For**
Server virtualization (data centers, private clouds)

Running multiple OSes on one machine (e.g., Windows + Linux)

Testing and development environments

Disaster recovery and snapshot-based backups


**Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal)**
Runs directly on the hardware.

Common in data centers and enterprise environments.

High performance and security

**Examples:**

VMware ESXi

Microsoft Hyper-V (when installed on bare-metal)

Xen

KVM (often used with Linux)

Oracle VM Server

**Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**
Runs on top of a host operating system, like a regular app.

Easier to set up, commonly used on desktops/laptops for testing or development.

**Examples:**

VMware Workstation

Oracle VirtualBox

Parallels Desktop

Microsoft Hyper-V (when installed on Windows OS
